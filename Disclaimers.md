# Site's Disclaimers / Disclosures
**These disclaimers and disclosures qualify the text of all articles posted on all 
other PFC-branded social media accounts maintained by AAA-Flowers,
or the PFC's built sites, as well as all information and features of the
websites at [pfc.zone](https://pfc.zone) &amp; [validator.tools](https://validator.tools) and all subdomains thereof (the “**Site**”) 
(all of the foregoing, including the Site, collectively, the “**Repository**”). 
These disclaimers and disclosure also incorporated into the Terms of Service for 
the Site.**

**Before interacting with any of these sites, please carefully review these disclaimers, 
any applicable terms and conditions, and the open-source code of the relevant software. 
Use the technology only at your own risk, and do not rely on the 
PFC, or Validator-tools for making any decisions.**

**Authorship**. The Repository has been authored by participants in the joint venture which developed 
the Site's technologies (such joint venture and each of its participants, the “**Joint Venture**”)
or other participants in the PFC community, as applicable. 
The PFC Medium account and Sites
are maintained by AAA-Flowers., a Panamanian company limited by shares.

**Informational Purposes Only; No Warranties**. The Repository is only a presentation of information regarding 
certain technologies. The statements contained in the Repository do not provide any advice, representation, 
warranty, certification, guarantee or promise relating to these technologies, any uses thereof or any of the 
other matters discussed in the Repository, nor does the Repository provide an offer or agreement to 
make such technologies available, maintain or update such technologies, or sell or buy any asset or enter 
into any transaction. You should not rely on the Repository as a basis for making any financial or other decision.

**No Governmental/Regulatory Review or Approval**. The Repository and the matters described in the Repository have 
not been reviewed, approved, endorsed or registered with any regulator or other governmental entity, and 
the authors of the Repository are not licensed by any regulator or other authority to provide any legal, 
financial, accounting, investment or other advice or services.

**Uncertain Nature of Forward-Looking Statements; No Duty to Update**. The forward-looking statements in the Repository 
are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, and thus the events described or predicted therein 
are subject to change or to fail to occur in accordance therewith. We undertake no obligation to update, 
supplement or amend any statement that becomes inaccurate or incomplete after the date on which the Repository 
is first published, or to alert the public as to any such inaccuracy or incompleteness, whether such 
inaccuracy or incompleteness arises as a result of new information we receive, changes of our plans, 
unanticipated events or otherwise.

**Experimental Technology**. The technologies and assets described in the Repository are highly experimental and risky, 
have uncertain and potentially volatile value, and should be directly evaluated by experts in blockchain 
technologies before use. Use them solely at your own risk.

**No Ongoing Management**. Consistent with the goals of community governance described in the Repository, 
after the public launch of the Site, the Joint Venture and its members and service providers should 
not be expected to have a material ongoing role in Site's maintenance, research, development or promotion.
The Joint Venture and its members have not dedicated capital specifically to future Site development 
and have no plans to raise capital dedicated specifically to Site's maintenance or development. 
The Joint Venture will not continue as a joint venture after the public launch of the Site.

**Recency of Data**. The Site Operator does not provide any representation, warranty or guarantee of the 
accuracy or recency of any data, but the Site infrastructure is designed 
with the intention of updating relevant data roughly every minute. Server-side or 
client/browser-side caching may also result in stale information, and client/browser-side caching is solely under the 
User’s control.

**Nothing is Offers, Promises or Contracts**. 
Nothing is offers, promises, agreements, guarantees or undertakings on the part of the Site Operator 
or any other person or group of persons. Nothing as displayed on the Site are projections based historical performance. 
The actual data depends primarily on the results of operation of smart contracts and other autonomous or 
semi-autonomous systems (including third-party systems) and how third parties interact with those systems 
after the time of your interaction.
